# micro-weave
This is my approach of combining everything I learned about microservices so far in a nice example in golang.
I don't want to focus on specific technologies here, but on a nice architecture and the most usable
and readable approach I can come up with. The goal should be a nice little service providing a rest-api
and using wide spread and production ready approaches. It should run in a docker conainter.

What are the first really nice tools that I loved to use and I want to include here:
- Swagger and the client code generation feature
- goqu or gorm would be nice
- vectra mockery or a better alternative
- nice web server & json libaries
